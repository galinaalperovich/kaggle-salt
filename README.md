# Kaggle Salt Identification challenge

I participate in a competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/tgs-salt-identification-challenge

This is my first attempt of using the fastai library and build the model only with it.

The task is to identify the segment of an image with the salt. Also, for every image the depth of the signals is provided.
